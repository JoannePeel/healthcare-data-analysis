## Project Description/Outline:

Triage, a concept developed and refined on the battlefield, has been central to the practice of emergency medicine for more than half a century. As emergency departments (EDs) face escalating patient volumes, persistent crowding, and patient populations with more complex disease, the need for accurate and reliable triage has intensified. 

Mexicoâ€™s emergency departments have also faced an important increment in patients, with 5,751,797 attended in 2008, and more almost twice the amount (10,645,625 patients) in 2014.

To deal with the increased patient load Mexican hospitals implement triage systems. Triage systems with published evidence of widespread adoption include the Australasian Triage Scale (ATS), Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS), Emergency Severity Index (ESI), Manchester Triage Scale (MTS), South African Triage Scale (SATS) and NEWS2. Currently, Mexican hospitals use MTS.

The objective of this project is to analyze data from INEGI, to determine the number of people insured by each institution in Mexico City (IMSS, ISSSTE, Seguro Popular and others); analyze the number of emergencies attended in Mexico City in the period from 2009-2016; calculate the increment rate of demand on emergency services; determine the number of qualified emergencies (real emergencies) and non-qualified emergencies (felt emergencies).

Finally, we are going to propose an electronic case report form (eCRF), for emergency room admission, which will automatically calculate MTS, NEWS2, MEWS for pregnant women, and PEWS for pediatric patients.

## Research Questions to Answer

- The percentage of people insured thorugh each of the health institutions in Mexico City
- The number of people attended each year in the emergency departments of each institution in Mexico City
- The number of real emergencies attended vs. "felt emergencies"
- Increase rate of patients attended in the emergency departments

## Data Sets to be Used

- INEGI API: 
- Datos de Urgencias - gob.mx -  https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/urgencias


## Rough Breakdown of Tasks:

### INEGI Data analysis
    
    1. To get the information from the INEGI API.

    2. To understand and map the INEGI API to a data frame on Pandas.

    3. Visualize the results using matplotlib
